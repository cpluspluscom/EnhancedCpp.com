Enhanced `cplusplus.com`
========================

This is a Chrome extension which modifies pages on [cplusplus.com](http://www.cplusplus.com/) to make the forums easier to use.

* Adds a quote button to each post on the last page of a topic
* Adds a code-ize button to eahc post on the last page of a topic - opens a new window with the entire post in code tags
* Makes quotes, code sections, and output sections act like spoiler tags (WIP)

## Rationale
Why are these features not part of the site already? The site owner is very busy and does not have time to add these features for us. These features don't require any server-side work so we can implement them ourselves. Plus, it effectively means the community can make the site look and act as they wish.
